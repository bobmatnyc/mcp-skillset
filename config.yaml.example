# MCP Skills Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.mcp-skills/config.yaml and customize as needed

# Hybrid Search Configuration
# Controls the weighting between vector similarity search and knowledge graph relationships
hybrid_search:
  # Option 1: Use a preset (recommended)
  # Available presets:
  #   - current: Default optimized preset (70% vector, 30% graph)
  #   - semantic_focused: Best for natural language queries (90% vector, 10% graph)
  #   - graph_focused: Best for finding related skills (30% vector, 70% graph)
  #   - balanced: Equal weighting for general purpose (50% vector, 50% graph)
  preset: current

  # Option 2: Specify custom weights (must sum to 1.0)
  # Uncomment and adjust these lines to use custom weights instead of a preset
  # vector_weight: 0.7  # Weight for vector similarity search (0.0-1.0)
  # graph_weight: 0.3   # Weight for knowledge graph relationships (0.0-1.0)

# Vector Store Configuration
vector_store:
  backend: chromadb  # chromadb, qdrant, or faiss
  embedding_model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2  # Sentence transformer model
  collection_name: skills_v1  # ChromaDB collection name

# Knowledge Graph Configuration
knowledge_graph:
  backend: networkx  # networkx or neo4j

# MCP Server Configuration
server:
  transport: stdio  # stdio, http, or sse
  port: 8000  # Port for HTTP transport
  log_level: info  # debug, info, warning, or error
  max_loaded_skills: 50  # Maximum skills to keep in memory

# Toolchain Detection
toolchain_cache_duration: 3600  # Cache duration in seconds
auto_recommend: true  # Automatically recommend skills on toolchain detection

# Repository Configuration (optional)
# repositories:
#   - url: https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-skills-core
#     priority: 90
#     auto_update: true
#   - url: https://github.com/your-org/custom-skills
#     priority: 80
#     auto_update: true

# Use Cases by Preset:
#
# current (0.7 vector, 0.3 graph) - DEFAULT
#   Best for: General-purpose skill discovery
#   Use when: You want balanced results with slight emphasis on semantic matching
#   Example: "python testing frameworks" → finds pytest, unittest with related testing skills
#
# semantic_focused (0.9 vector, 0.1 graph)
#   Best for: Natural language queries, fuzzy matching, concept-based search
#   Use when: You have vague requirements or want semantic similarity
#   Example: "help me debug async code" → emphasizes semantic understanding over relationships
#
# graph_focused (0.3 vector, 0.7 graph)
#   Best for: Discovering related skills, exploring dependencies, finding skill clusters
#   Use when: You want to explore what skills work together or depend on each other
#   Example: Starting from "pytest" → discovers pytest-fixtures, pytest-mock, test-coverage
#
# balanced (0.5 vector, 0.5 graph)
#   Best for: General purpose when you want equal emphasis
#   Use when: You're unsure which approach is better for your query
#   Example: "javascript testing" → equal weight to semantic match and relationships

# CLI Usage Examples:
#
# Use config file preset:
#   mcp-skills search "python testing"
#
# Override with CLI flag:
#   mcp-skills search "python testing" --search-mode semantic_focused
#   mcp-skills recommend --search-mode graph_focused
#
# Available CLI flags:
#   --search-mode semantic_focused  # 90% vector, 10% graph
#   --search-mode graph_focused     # 30% vector, 70% graph
#   --search-mode balanced          # 50% vector, 50% graph
#   --search-mode current           # 70% vector, 30% graph (default)
