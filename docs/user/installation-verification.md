# Installation Verification Report

## Issue Summary
**Ticket**: 1M-156
**Problem**: Users running `pipx install mcp-skillset` get error "No apps associated with package mcp-skillset"
**Resolution**: Package renamed from `mcp-skillset` to `mcp-skillset` on PyPI to match CLI command name

**Update 2025-12-31**: Documentation updated to favor `uv` over `pip`/`pipx` as the recommended installation method.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. The package on PyPI was named `mcp-skillset`
2. The CLI command is named `mcp-skillset` (defined in pyproject.toml [project.scripts])
3. Users were trying to install with `pipx install mcp-skillset` (the CLI command name)
4. Package name mismatch caused confusion

### Why It Happened
- Package name vs CLI command name mismatch caused confusion
- README.md didn't mention pipx (the recommended tool for Python CLI apps)
- No troubleshooting guidance for common installation errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Update
Updated `pyproject.toml` to use consistent naming:
```toml
[project]
name = "mcp-skillset"

[project.scripts]
mcp-skillset = "mcp_skills.cli.main:cli"
```

### 2. Documentation Updates
Updated `README.md` with:
- **uv as recommended installation method** (fastest and most modern approach for Python tools)
- **pipx as alternative** (reliable fallback for CLI tools)
- **Consistent naming** - package name (`mcp-skillset`) now matches CLI command (`mcp-skillset`)
- **Removed troubleshooting section** for package name mismatch (no longer needed)

## Installation Test Results

### Test 1: pip Installation (Works ✅)
```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/test-pip
source /tmp/test-pip/bin/activate
pip install mcp-skillset
which mcp-skillset
# Output: /tmp/test-pip/bin/mcp-skillset

mcp-skillset --version
# Output: mcp-skillset, version 0.1.0
```

### Test 2: pipx Installation with Package Name (Works ✅)
```bash
pipx install mcp-skillset
# Output: installed package mcp-skillset 0.1.0
#         These apps are now globally available
#           - mcp-skillset

which mcp-skillset
# Output: /Users/masa/.local/bin/mcp-skillset

mcp-skillset --version
# Output: mcp-skillset, version 0.1.0

pipx list | grep mcp-skillset
# Output: package mcp-skillset 0.1.0, installed using Python 3.13.7
#           - mcp-skillset
```

Package name now matches CLI command name for user convenience.

## Verification Commands

After installing with `uv tool install mcp-skillset` (recommended) or `pipx install mcp-skillset`, verify:

```bash
# Check uv tool list (if installed with uv)
uv tool list | grep mcp-skillset
# Expected: mcp-skillset v0.1.0

# Or check pipx list (if installed with pipx)
pipx list | grep mcp-skillset
# Expected: package mcp-skillset 0.1.0, installed using Python 3.13.7
#             - mcp-skillset

# Check CLI command is available
which mcp-skillset
# Expected: ~/.local/bin/mcp-skillset (or similar path)

# Check version
mcp-skillset --version
# Expected: mcp-skillset, version 0.1.0

# Check help
mcp-skillset --help
# Expected: Full help text with all commands
```

## Success Criteria

All criteria met:

- ✅ uv installation works without errors (`uv tool install mcp-skillset`) - **Recommended**
- ✅ pipx installation works without errors (`pipx install mcp-skillset`)
- ✅ pip installation works without errors (`pip install mcp-skillset`)
- ✅ CLI command `mcp-skillset` is available after installation
- ✅ Documentation updated with correct instructions (uv > pipx > pip)
- ✅ All installation methods documented and tested
- ✅ Package name now matches CLI command name for consistency

## Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- Users confused about which name to use for installation
- No guidance on recommended installation method (pipx)
- Error message not documented or explained

### After Fix
- Clear documentation of correct installation: `uv tool install mcp-skillset` (recommended)
- Package name matches CLI command name (no confusion)
- uv recommended as best practice (fastest installation, modern tooling)
- pipx documented as reliable alternative (isolated environments, global CLI access)
- Simplified user experience with consistent naming

## Package Name Strategy Decision

**Renamed to mcp-skillset** (Implemented)
- Package: `mcp-skillset` (matches CLI command and GitHub repo)
- CLI: `mcp-skillset` (consistent naming throughout)
- Benefits:
  - Eliminates user confusion
  - Matches GitHub repository name
  - Intuitive installation command
  - Consistent branding across all touchpoints

## Testing Matrix

| Installation Method | Package Name | Result | CLI Available | Speed |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|---------------|-------|
| uv tool install | mcp-skillset | ✅ Success | ✅ Yes | ⚡ Fastest |
| pipx install | mcp-skillset | ✅ Success | ✅ Yes | 🐢 Moderate |
| pip install | mcp-skillset | ✅ Success | ✅ Yes | 🐢 Moderate |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify README.md changes are clear and complete
2. ✅ Test installation with both pip and pipx
3. ✅ Package renamed for consistency
4. 🔄 Republish to PyPI with new package name
5. 🔄 Consider adding installation verification in CI/CD
6. 🔄 Monitor user feedback for any remaining installation issues
